**2. Addressing PHP-Related Issues on Netlify**

Netlify is optimized for static site hosting and doesn't support server-side languages like PHP for runtime execution. This means PHP scripts, such as those used for form handling, won't function as intended on Netlify. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**Alternative Solutions:**

- **Netlify Forms:** Utilize Netlify's built-in form handling feature, which allows form submissions without the need for server-side code. This is ideal for static sites and integrates seamlessly with Netlify's infrastructure. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **External Form Handling Services:** Consider using third-party services like Formspree or Zapier to manage form submissions. These services can process form data and send it to your email or other destinations without requiring PHP.

- **Serverless Functions:** If your form processing requires more complex logic, you can implement serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda) to handle form submissions. Netlify supports serverless functions, enabling you to write backend code without managing a separate server.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Implement Netlify Forms:**
   - Add a `name` attribute to your `<form>` tag to enable Netlify to detect and process it.
   - Ensure your form has a proper `action` attribute and uses the `POST` method.

2. **Explore Serverless Functions:**
   - If needed, set up serverless functions within Netlify to handle more advanced form processing.

3. **Update Your Repository:**
   - Reflect these changes in your GitHub repository and update the README accordingly.

By adopting these approaches, you can effectively manage form submissions on your Netlify-hosted portfolio without relying on PHP.
